## About This Project

This project is a three-page responsive website for a fictional digital agency called **DevAgency**. The site includes a home page, a blog page, and an about page. It was built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap 5 framework, following a set of provided design mockups at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1440px) screen sizes.

## My Process

I started by reviewing the design mockups carefully before writing any code. I set up the project folder structure first, then built the HTML for all three pages using semantic elements. After that, I linked Bootstrap 5 and wrote the custom CSS in `style.css` using CSS variables for colours and fonts.

I worked mobile-first, writing base styles for small screens and then adding media queries for tablet and desktop breakpoints. I used Bootstrap's grid system (`col-12`, `col-md-4`, `col-md-6`) to handle the column layouts and made sure the navbar collapsed into a hamburger menu on mobile.

## Challenges I Faced

**Responsive images:** Getting the `<picture>` element to work correctly with `srcset`, `sizes`, and `media` attributes took some trial and error. I had to understand the difference between using `media` to switch image files versus using `srcset` with width descriptors for the browser to choose automatically.

**Navbar overlay on hero image:** Making the navbar sit on top of the hero image (instead of pushing it down) required using `position: absolute` on the navbar, which was new to me. I had to make sure the hero section had `position: relative` so the navbar would be positioned relative to it.

**CSS specificity:** When I tried to apply different background colours to each "What We Provide" card using `:nth-child`, I ran into a selector specificity problem. I learned that I needed to target the parent column (`.col-md-4:nth-child(n)`) rather than the card itself, because each card is always the first child of its own column div.

**Equal-height cards:** Making blog and team cards in the same grid row equal in height required `height: 100%`, `display: flex`, and `flex-direction: column` on the card, with `flex: 1` on the card body to fill remaining space.

## What I Learned

- How to use CSS custom properties (variables) to keep colours and fonts consistent and easy to change across a project.
- How the Bootstrap grid system works and how to combine it with custom CSS without conflicts.
- How `position: absolute` and `position: relative` work together to layer elements on top of each other.
- How the `<picture>` element, `srcset`, `sizes`, and `media` attributes work to serve responsive images.
- The importance of semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- How CSS Grid can be used to reliably overlay text on top of an image without relying on absolute positioning.
